I know this is complex for most people.  BUT I do know that there are a few people out there that have the ability to build a complete working modern computer from the raw materials.  \n\nI will list some feedback from people \"in the field\" that I have discussed this with so you all do not say the same thing and we can move along together:\n\n1. \"It take thousands of people to build a computer, there is absolutely no way that you are going to do it alone.\" \n^ Yes, I understand this.  I want to make it clear that I most likely will NOT be making a modern computer from the raw materials.  I just want to have the knowledge to be able to if I wanted to one day.  This whole journey came to existence after I became introduced to a community where there are tons of master craftsman, blacksmiths, miners, rock hounds, etc.  People who do everything themselves really from scratch.  They make their own glass, pots, pans, etc. from raw materials that they actually go out, identify, mine, and utilize.\n\n2. \"Modern computers are very complex.  I don't think anyone has the knowledge that you are looking for specifically.  You may be wasting your time in this pursuit.\"\n^ This is a very valid concern and I really hope they are totally incorrect.  I have not found a single person that knows this or have I been able to find a single book or books that cover this.  Now this brings me to my question and the reason I am here. \n\nI am hoping and wishing that someone here has the knowledge that I am seeking out and can play librarian for me.  I will do the reading and homework on my own.  I just need someone who 100% has the knowledge that I am looking for to recommend me books that will teach me what I need to know to build one truly from scratch.  I don't care if it is 10 books or even 80 books.  As long as the librarian recommending these books is absolutely sure that the books s/he recommends will teach me what I need to know and does not assume absolutely any prior knowledge.  So, that would mean that the person should list the books that need to be read in the proper order that I would need to read them.  \n\nSo, so far I have read two books and am on my third book.  \n1. \"How Computers Work\" by Roger Young   \n^ I read this book already.  This book started out ok but got really messy very fast. \n\n2. \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n^ I just finished reading this book three days ago.  The second link I mentioned was the reason why I read that book.  I thought that was a great book!  Got messy towards the end, so not the best but still a good informative read.  \n\n3. \"The Elements of Computing Systems\" by Noam Nisan\n^ I just started reading this book two days ago.  The second link I mentioned above is the reason for this book.  So far, this book is very messy.  I am not liking it that much.  It assumes a lot when I didn't think it would. \n\n--------------- \n\nOk, so that's that.  Now if you wanted to get a feel of what is randomly going on in my head pertaining to this and asked me, \"What are your thoughts on your learning so far?\".  This is what I think so far.  \n\na. you need to understand the importance of numbers and mathematics.  I know some people might think, \"What!?  That's common sense!\".  Well, like I said, please do not assume anything with me.  Call me stupid but I did not and still do not totally understand math but I am comfortable with what I have learned in my research.  The first thing I say read is \"The origins of mathematics\" in this link from Texas A&M University: \nhttp://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/hist_frame.htm\n\nDon't worry about the other eleven readings.  That first one is what you need to read.  After that, again Petzold's code explains stuff on this well too.\n\nc. Next, I would say read just the first few pages of Roger Young's book: \nhttp://www.fastchip.net/howcomputerswork/p1.html\n\nI like the circuit diagram there.  To understand this fully though, read wikipedia about the history of batteries to understand how to construct a primitive one.  Next (and I haven't done this yet) you need to get a good rock identifying book to learn about the different rocks/ores from which metals are obtained.  mindat.org is a resource.  Also, research about blacksmithing just to understand the blacksmith process.  Focusing on the process is important for now.  Such as: \nGeology/prospecting to locate and identify the raw metal ores needed in building the relay and battery.  Mining skills to extract them. Blacksmithing/Metallurgy skills to extract the metal itself, make the metal plates for the battery, and make the wire and switch for the relay.  Pottery skills to make the ceramic container to hold the primitive battery and finally homesteading/glassmaking skills to make the charcoal from wood for the primitive lightbulb.\n\nc. You need to understand is what a computer is now and what it meant historically.  I could expand on this but I feel that Petzold's Code explains this well. \n\nSo that is what I think so far.  I do think there are some things that I am missing which is probably why I have 50 pages worth of unanswered questions in MS Word for Petzold's Code book.  But this is what I have so far.  I will stop for now though because I am so eager to see what the expert librarians have in store for me here! :)", "probability_closed": "49.5", "open": "false", "id": "11881797", "title": "books to learn computers as if building from raw materials (ie mineral ores)"}, {"body": "I am a Master's Software Engineer student.

Since it was kinda slow in the beginning, I decided to learn Python on my own the weeks before the course started up to now (1 month into the course). In the past week I've been trying to learn Django (reading the django book) since I feel like Python is useless without a framework, or so I read on forums. It's difficult to understand especially since I'm teaching myself. However, now we're starting to learn JavaScript in the class. \n\nShould I just put down Python/Django and put all my energy into JS? My main reason in starting Django was just to understand how complicated a framework will be before we start the Ruby/Rails portion. However, it's really hard trying to understand and I wonder if if practicing JS/jQuery will improve my programming skills more than just reading up on Python/Django.

My dream job is working on spacecraft and getting into the private space industry.  So if anyone knows anything about languages specifically used in that field all the better.  I'm not opposed to learning a language for its own sake, but ideally I'd like something that could be potentially useful down the line.\n\nThus far I have 8 years of experience with c, c++ and Java (including some mild professional work via internship), and have recently spent a semester learning Python.  My curriculum will also have me learning VHDL in the near future.  Research largely via forums and wikipedia has led me to the following:\n\n\nI've considered teaching myself Ada, and while I like a lot of what I've read about the language it seems to be dying; with the few Ada programmers I've found online simply maintaining ancient code-bases.\n\nI've also considered learning assembly, in fact my University offers a course in it (not sure of the specific variety).  However while I'm sure the low-level knowledge would be informative, I know with advances in microcontrollers there's little advantage to optimizing at the assembly level; so I question its practical utility.\n\nFinally I've even considered common lisp.  I know it isn't one of the embedded languages du jour, but I've read a little about its applications to artificial intelligence, and given that the future seems to be headed towards more completely autonomous systems I figure knowledge of it might be useful in that regard.   Plus it would be a refreshing departure from yet another c++ style syntax, and I wouldn't mind putting the \"learning lisp will make you a better all-around programmer\" slogan I've heard from lisp fanbois to the test. :)\n\nThat's the three I've narrowed it down to from my research, but I'm not locked into them by any means.

Where as Java, would be the Functionality and Complex Interaction of Javascript and HTML/XHTML. \n\nIt went into it using that comparison a little further, but didnt continue on that path unfortunately. \n\nI thought it was great.

I was able to log into the router via its WAN port, so I know its working too.
